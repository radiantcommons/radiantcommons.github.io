		<h3>the mission</h3>
		<p>Radiant Commons is an organization focused on the support of technologies that empower users to consent to how and when their information is used.</p>
		<p>Radiant focuses on four main activities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>We advocate for the growth of protocol ecosystems that we believe will create a better present for the most people.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>We facilitate coordination  between consentful technological ecosystems.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>We help users govern and contribute to open-source technologies.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Finally, we incubate teams building consentful technologies with the goal of spinning them out into independent entities.</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p>You and your information should feel safe on the internet. Radiant is here to make that happen. The future is dark. The future is Radiant.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>our culture</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>We focus on outcomes, not processes, but recognize that processes can make outcomes more achievable.</li>
			<li>We ask 'why?' and we never act as though we know something for sure until we know something for sure. If we don't know something for sure, we seek out the next person who might.</li>
			<li>We move as a unit and work together, so that where we can, anyone can fill in for anyone else.</li>
			<li>We own our success and we celebrate our achievements, both as individuals and as a team</li>
			<li>We ship. All of our work is scoped for success and what the achievable looks like, and we do it in the least amount of time possible to validate our assumptions.</li>
			<li>We play to win.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h3>open roles</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Coming Soon - though we are always willing to have a conversation. Reach out if you are interested in working together</li>
		</ul>
